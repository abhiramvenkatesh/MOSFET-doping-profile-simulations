INTRODUCTION:\
This project was done todevelop a single RESURF structure for better breakdown voltage as compared to traditional silicone based MOSFET structures.
In this MOSFET structure we have used silicone as the base forthe MOSFET. 
We have choosed depletion mode for the conduction of the current.\
\
Counclusions:\
With this new structure we were able to get the breakdown voltage upto 120V as compared to the traditional 80V breakdown for the silicone MOSFET.
